# Memes
#Project Overview
MemeMe is a meme-generating app that enables a user to attach a caption to a picture from their phone. After adding text to an image chosen from the Photo Album or Camera, the user can share it with friends. MemeMe also temporarily stores sent memes which users can browse in a table or a grid. It is developed as a part of Udacity Nanodegree Program.

#Why this project?
MemeMe covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience.

#What Will I learn?
Set up a navigation structure that creates an intuitive flow through the app
Build tables with datasources and delegates
Create custom table view cells
Implement user interfaces with tab views and collection views
Why is this project meaningful to my career?
Becoming comfortable using all of the key components of UIKit is an essential step in becoming an iOS developer.
Understanding UIKit allows a developer to make educated assumptions about the architecture of apps that they use.
Mastering UKit fundamentals frees a developer up to learn model-oriented skills like networking and persistence.
